I"¢<p>I have gradually come to appreciate how much insight can be found in
Asymptotic Statistics by van der Vaartâ€™s (henceforth vdV). I have come
to appreciate this only gradually because I have only gradually become
able to actually read the damn thing. I am still able to read it only
with some effort, an effort which is usually worthwhile. But I often
wish there were some kind of Cliffâ€™s Notes for the book.</p>
