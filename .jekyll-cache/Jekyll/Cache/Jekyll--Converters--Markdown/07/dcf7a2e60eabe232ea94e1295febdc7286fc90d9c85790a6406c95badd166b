I"76<p>Over the course of two posts, I’d like to provide an intuitive walk-through of a
proof of the Bayesian central limit theorem (BCLT, aka the Bernstein-von Mises
theorem).  I think most statisticans can probably sketch the arguments leading
to the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator off the
top of their head, but I suspect that few could do the same for the BCLT.
I, at least, found a lot of the BCLT literature a bit intimidating and short
on intuition.  But there’s intuition to be had, and I’d like to take a stab
at providing some of it.</p>

<p>I will focus on attributes of the posterior that can be expressed using
posterior expectations, which includes both total variation distance (the most
commonly used form of convergence) and series expansions of posterior means. My
approach will be based principally on on the proof of Theorem 1.4.2 in the book
<em>Bayesian Nonparametrics</em> by Ghosh and Ramamoorthi, though the elements are to
some degree common to all the proofs of the finite-dimensional BCLT that I am
aware of.  In particular, the division into the three regions I will describe in
the next post is, as far as I can am aware, the only game in town for the BCLT,
though the precise details of how the regions are dealt with differ according to
the need of the authors.</p>

<p>Again, my goal is not to reproduce the proof in full detail, but rather to
sketch the intuition underlying it.  Consequently, I’ll be a little fast and
loose about necessary conditions for standard asymptotic results, and will not
always add qualifying filler like the phrase “under necessary regularity
conditions.”</p>

<p>Throughout, I’ll assume we have independent and identically distributed (IID)
data \(x=(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\), a parametric model \(p(x_n | \theta)\), and a prior
density on the scalar parameter \(\pi(\theta)\) which is defined with respect to
the Lebesgue measure.  Idential arguments work with multivariate parameters
where the Taylor series residuals are controlled by the integral form of the
remainder rather than the mean value theorem.  To avoid tedious notation, we’ll
just focus on the scalar case.</p>

<p>In thie first post, I’ll discuss the two key tools that go into the BCLT: the
Taylor series, and uniform laws of large numbers.  I’ll start by reviewing the
use of these two tools in the classical proof of the asymptotic normality of the
MLE, concluding with a discussion of why the arguments that work for the MLE are
not enough for Bayesian posteriors.  Hopefully, the reader will then find
themselves motivated to resolve the cliffhanger with the next post!</p>

<h2 id="notation-and-maximum-likelihood-estimators">Notation and Maximum Likelihood Estimators</h2>

<p>Let us begin by reviewing the proof of the asymptotic normality of the
maximum likelihood estimator (MLE).  Versions of this proof are standard, and can
be found, for example, in Chapter 6 of Theory of Point Estimation by Lehmann.</p>

<p>I’ll write log probabilities like so: \(\log p(x_n | \theta) = \ell(x_n |
\theta)\).   The MLE is defined as follows:</p>

\[\begin{align*}
\hat\theta :=&amp;
    \mathrm{argmax}_\theta \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell(x_n | \theta)\\
\theta_0 :=&amp;
    \mathrm{argmax}_\theta \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[\ell(x_1 | \theta)].
\end{align*}\]

<p>Here, \(\mathbb{E}_{x_1}\) denotes expectation over a single datapoint for a
fixed \(\theta\), so \(\mathbb{E}_{x_1}[\ell(x_1 | \theta)]\) is a function of
\(\theta\) alone. One typically has to worry about whether \(\hat\theta\) and
\(\theta_0\) are uniquely defined, and establish that \(\hat\theta \rightarrow
\theta_0\) as \(N\) grows large.  Let’s assume that we have resolved such
concerns.</p>

<p>I’ll be using a Taylor series, and for that, it will be convenient to denote
partial derivatives with subscripts, i.e.,</p>

\[\begin{align*}
\ell_{(k)}(x_1 \vert \theta) :=
    \left.\frac{\partial^k \ell(x_1 \vert \theta)}{\partial \theta^k}
    \right|_\theta.
\end{align*}\]

<p>In this notation, we can form the following Taylor series expansion of
the first derivative of the log likelihood around the true parameter:</p>

\[\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(1)}(x_n \vert \hat\theta) =
    \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(1)}(x_n \vert \theta_0) +
    \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(2)}(x_n \vert \tilde{\theta}) (\hat\theta - \theta_0),
\end{align*}\]

<p>where we have used the mean value theorem to evaluated the Taylor series
residual at some \(\tilde{\theta}\) where \(|\tilde{\theta} - \theta_0 | &lt;
|\hat\theta - \theta_0 |\).</p>

<p>By definition of \(\hat\theta\), \(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(1)}(x_n \vert
\hat\theta) = 0\), so we can rerrange the Taylor series expansion to
get</p>

\[\sqrt{N} (\hat\theta - \theta_0) =
\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(1)}(x_n \vert \theta_0)}
     {- \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(2)}(x_n \vert \tilde{\theta})}.\]

<p>The left-hand side of the preceding display is the quantity we’re interested in,
the limiting behavior of the MLE.  What is the limiting behavior of the right
hand side?</p>

<h2 id="uniform-laws-of-large-numbers-ullns">Uniform Laws of Large Numbers (ULLNs)</h2>

<p>First, the easy term.  Since \(\mathbb{E}_{x_1}[\ell_{(1)}(x_n \vert \theta_0)] =
0\) by the definition of \(\theta_0\), the ordinary central limit theorem gives</p>

\[\begin{align*}
\Sigma :=&amp; \mathrm{Cov}_{x_1}(\ell_{(1)}(x_1 \vert \theta_0)) \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(1)}(x_n \vert \theta_0)
  \rightsquigarrow&amp; \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma).
\end{align*}\]

<p>For the denominator, we might wish we could use the fact that, by the ordinary
LLN,</p>

\[\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(2)}(x_n \vert \theta_0) \rightarrow
    \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[\ell_{(2)}(x_1 | \theta)] =: -\mathcal{I},\]

<p>which converges to the negative Fisher information by the ordinary law of large
numbers, since \(\theta_0\) is fixed, if unknown. (In correctly specified
models, \(\Sigma = \mathcal{I}\), but I will keep them separate, in part
because I am interested in misspecified models.)</p>

<p>However, our expression has \(\tilde{\theta}\), not \(\theta_0\).  Recall that
\(\tilde{\theta}\) is chosen based on \(\hat\theta\), and so, in general,
depends on the data!  Due to this data dependence, we cannot simply apply the
LLN, and must turn to a stronger result, a uniform law of large numbers, or
ULLN.</p>

<p>A ULLN says that, within some interval, the random function
\(\theta \mapsto \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(2)}(x_n \vert \theta)\)
converges <em>uniformly</em> to the deterministic function
\(\theta \mapsto \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[\ell_{(2)}(x_1 | \theta)]\).  Specifically,
for some ball \(B_\theta\) containing \(\theta_0\),</p>

\[\sup_{\theta \in B_\theta} \left|
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(2)}(x_n \vert \theta) -
\mathbb{E}_{x_1}[\ell_{(2)}(x_1 | \theta)]
\right| \rightarrow 0.\]

<p>As written, this is actually a tad stronger than we need, since we know that
\(\tilde{\theta} \rightarrow \theta_0\), which means that any ball
\(B_\theta\) of fixed size will be “bigger than necessary.”  Nevertheless,
it is common to assume a ULLN, with the understanding that you are free
to make \(B_\theta\) as small as necessary.</p>

<p>The study of what conditions imply a ULLN is a rich topic.  But an easily
applicable criterion is that the function of interest be bounded by an
integrable envelope.  Specifically: a function \(f(\theta, x_n)\) obeys a ULLN
in \(B_\theta\) if there exists a non-negative function \(M(x)\), with
\(\mathbb{E}_{x_1}[M(x_1)] &lt; \infty\), such that</p>

\[\left| f(\theta, x_1) \right| \le M(x_1)\quad
\textrm{for all possible }x_1\textrm{ and all }
\theta \in B_\theta.\]

<p>(See van der Vaart’s Asymptotic Statistics, Example 19.7, which actually states
a somewhat weaker requirement.)</p>

<p>Classical proofs often assume an integrable envelope condition, even if they do
not use it directly in a ULLN.  Lehmann’s <em>Theory of Point Estimation</em>, for
example, proves asymptotic normality of the MLE under the condition that
\(\ell_{3}(x_n \vert \theta)\) has an integrable envelope, though he does not
use this directly in a ULLN (see Eq. 15 in Theorem 2.3 of section 6.2). I find
proofs to be simpler if you simply lean on a ULLN, though this might be a matter
of taste.</p>

<p>A ULLN basically allows you to ignore the dependence of \(\tilde{\theta}\)
on the data, since \(\tilde{\theta}\) is eventually in any \(B_\theta\), and</p>

\[\begin{align*}
&amp;\left| \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(2)}(x_n \vert \tilde{\theta})  -
       \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[\ell_{(2)}(x_1 | \theta_0)]
\right| \le \\
&amp;\quad
\left| \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(2)}(x_n \vert \tilde{\theta})  -
       \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[\ell_{(2)}(x_1 | \tilde{\theta})]
\right| +
\left|
    \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[\ell_{(2)}(x_1 | \tilde{\theta})] -
    \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[\ell_{(2)}(x_1 | \theta_0)]
\right| \le\\
&amp;\quad
\sup_{\theta \in B_\theta }
\left| \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(2)}(x_n \vert \theta)  -
       \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[\ell_{(2)}(x_1 | \theta)]
\right| +
\left|
    \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[\ell_{(2)}(x_1 | \tilde{\theta})] -
    \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[\ell_{(2)}(x_1 | \theta_0)]
\right| \rightarrow\\
&amp;\quad 0 + 0,
\end{align*}\]

<p>where the first term follows from the ULLN and the second from assumed
continuity of \(\theta \mapsto \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[\ell_{(2)}(x_1 | \theta)]\)
and the consistency of \(\hat\theta\).</p>

<p>For the remainder of this stroll, we’ll take the above argument for granted, and
simply treat quantities like \(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N
\ell_{(2)}(x_n \vert \tilde{\theta})\) as if they were evaluated at a fixed
\(\theta_0\) whenever we know \(\tilde{\theta}\) will eventually land in
an arbitrarily small ball around \(\hat\theta\).</p>

<p>One final observation about ULLNs is important — it is not reasonable
to expect a ULLN to hold, in general, on non-compact sets.  A simple
counterexample is maybe the most useful way to illustrate this.  Consider
the function \(f(\theta, x_n) = (x_n - \theta)^2\).  Should a ULLN apply
to this function for \(\theta \in \mathbb{R}\)?  No, because</p>

\[\begin{align*}
&amp;\sup_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}}\left|
    \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N (x_n - \theta)^2 -
    \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[(x_1 - \theta)^2]
\right| =\\
&amp;\quad
\sup_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}}\left|
    \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2 - 2 \theta \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N  x_n
     + \theta^2 -
    \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[x_1^2] + 2 \theta \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[x_1] - \theta^2
\right| \ge\\
&amp;\quad
2 \sup_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}}|\theta | \left|
     \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N  x_n - \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[x_1]
\right| -
\left|
    \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2 - \mathbb{E}_{x_1}[x_1^2]
\right| =  \infty.
\end{align*}\]

<p>No matter how close the observed data moments are to their population versions,
the fact that \(\theta\) can take arbitrarily large values means the small
errors in the \(x_n\) moments get magnified to arbitrarily large errors in the
\(f(\theta, x_n)\) moments.  This observation will be important for the BCLT.</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</h2>

<p>Recall that a Taylor series gave:</p>

\[\sqrt{N} (\hat\theta - \theta_0) =
\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(1)}(x_n \vert \theta_0)}
     {- \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(2)}(x_n \vert \tilde{\theta})}.\]

<p>An ordinary CLT showed that</p>

\[\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{n=1}^N \ell_{(1)}(x_n \vert \theta_0)
    \rightsquigarrow&amp; \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma\]

<p>And our ULLN applied to \(\) showed that</p>

\[\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N
\ell_{(2)}(x_n \vert \tilde{\theta})\]

<p>Putting these three facts together with Slutsky’s theorem gives our final
result:</p>

\[\sqrt{N} (\hat\theta - \theta_0)
    \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{N}\left(0, \mathcal{I}^{-2} \Sigma \right).\]

<p>Again, in correctly specified models, \(\Sigma = \mathcal{I}\) and
the limiting variance is the classical \(\mathcal{I}^{-1}\).</p>

<h2 id="why-is-the-bclt-harder-than-asymptotic-normality-of-the-mle">Why is the BCLT harder than asymptotic normality of the MLE?</h2>

<p>To prove the asymptotic normality of the MLE, we had to repeatedly use the
closeness of \(\hat\theta\) to \(\theta_0\).  In particular, we used the
closeness of \(\hat\theta\) to \(\theta_0\) to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be able to apply a ULLN (since \(\hat\theta\) was in a compact set)</li>
  <li>Exploit the contiunity of the expected second derivative</li>
  <li>Have the residual in the Taylor series go to zero.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, for the MLE, we never had to consider the behavior of
\(\ell(x_n | \theta)\) for \(\theta\) any further from \(\theta_0\)
than an arbitrarily small ball, \(B_\theta\).</p>

<p>What about the BCLT?  Bayesian posterior expectation
of some function \(\phi(\theta)\) are given by</p>

\[\mathbb{E}[\phi(\theta) | x] =
\frac{\int \phi(\theta) \exp(\sum_{n=1}^N \ell(x_n | \theta))\pi(\theta) d\theta}
     {\int \exp(\sum_{n=1}^N \ell(x_n | \theta))\pi(\theta) d\theta}.\]

<p>Recall that posterior expectations involve integrals of
the form \(\int \phi(\theta) \exp(\sum_{n=1}^N \ell(x_n | \theta))\pi(\theta)
d\theta\). In general, \(\pi(\theta)\) and \(\phi(\theta)\) are quite nonzero over
all of \(\mathbb{R}\).  The MLE argument will help us deal with the part of the
Bayesian integral that is over an asymptotically shrinking neighborhood of
\(\hat\theta\); indeed, in such a shrinking neighborhood, the arguments will be
essentially the same.</p>

<p>It is the rest of the domain (typically a set with prior
probability approaching one!) that requires special care for the BCLT.  Indeed,
the core of the BCLT consists in showing that, asymptotically, one can <em>neglect</em>
all but a shrinking neighborhood of \(\hat\theta\) in posterior computations.
It is these arguments that we will take up in the next post.</p>
