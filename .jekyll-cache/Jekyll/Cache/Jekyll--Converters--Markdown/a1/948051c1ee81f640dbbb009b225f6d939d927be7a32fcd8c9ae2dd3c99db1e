I"©<p>Iâ€™m going to be speaking next week at <a href="https://mc-stan.org/events/stancon2020/">Stancon
2020</a> about a project Iâ€™ve been trying
to wrap up this summer: the Bayesian (first-order) infinitesimal jackknife.  The
idea is very simple: itâ€™s a combination of the Bayesian sensitivity Theorem 1 of
our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02536">Covariances, Robustness, and Variational Bayes
paper</a> with the general approach of our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00550">Swiss
Army Infinitesimal Jackknife paper</a>, applied
to estimate the frequentist variance as in, say, Section 3.5 of The Influence
Curve and its Role in Robust Estimation (Hampel, 1974).</p>
