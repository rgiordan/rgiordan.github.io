I"«<p>Why keep an open research journal?  Surely not for the sake of readers. There
are already many great data science, statistics, and machine learning books and
blogs out there and there is no shortage of good reading.  No, this journal is
for me.  Careful writing is an important part of my own thinking process, and I
write more carefully when I imagine someone else might be reading.  The amount
of time between journal or conference submissions is too long, and the lag
between small group presentations is too short.  I find myself wanting something
in between, and I hope this blog will fill the gap.</p>

<p>So I will use this space to write about things that I find worth thinking
through.  By doing so, I hope to help myself think through them.  If you also
find these things interesting, that is great!  If you think I am wrong, that is
also great!  In either case, feel free to send me an email and Iâ€™ll be happy to
chat.</p>
