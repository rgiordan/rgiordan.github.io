I am currently a Statistics Postdoctoral Associate in Tamara Broderickâ€™s group
at MIT. I received his PhD in statistics from UC Berkeley, where I was advised
by Michael Jordan, Tamara Broderick, and Jon McAuliffe. I've additionally earned
an MSc with distinction in econometrics and mathematical economics from the
London School of Economics and undergraduate degrees in mathematics and
theoretical and applied mechanics from the University of Illinois in
Urbana-Champaign. In between studies, I have worked as an engineer for Google
and HP and served as an education volunteer in the US Peace Corps in Kazakhstan.
My current research interests include variational methods, Bayesian robustness,
sensitivity analysis, open software, and --- presumptuously --- the philosophy
of science.
