<img src="/assets/images/ryan_portrait_2019.jpg" alt="drawing" width="100" align="left" hspace="10">

I am currently a statistics postdoc in Tamara Broderickâ€™s group at MIT. I
received my PhD in statistics from UC Berkeley, where I was advised by Michael
Jordan, Tamara Broderick, and Jon McAuliffe. I've additionally earned an MSc
with distinction in econometrics and mathematical economics from the London
School of Economics and undergraduate degrees in mathematics and theoretical and
applied mechanics from the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. In
between studies, I have worked as an engineer for Google and HP and served as an
education volunteer in the US Peace Corps in Kazakhstan. My current research
interests include variational methods, Bayesian robustness, sensitivity
analysis, open software.  I also have an amateur interest in the philosophy of
science.
