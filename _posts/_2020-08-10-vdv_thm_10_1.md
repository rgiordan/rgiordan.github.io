### Definitions.

Put definitions here.


### Size of the regions we're considering.

Actually you should do this in LaTeX so you can use macros.

### First two equations on page 142.

The intution is that, if two distributions differ only by conditioning on
some event, then they cannot be too difference if that event has very low
probablity.

For me, the notation gets in the way a little here.  For generic
sets $$B$$ and $$C$$, we want to control $$P(B) - P(B | C)$$
in terms of $$P(C^c)$$.  Let's write everything out without conditioning,
decompose into terms involving $$C^c$$, and see what we get:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(B) - P(B | C) =& P(B) - \frac{P(B \bigcap C)}{P(C)} \\
=& P(B \bigcap C^c) + P(B \bigcap C) - \frac{P(B \bigcap C)}{P(C)} \\
=& P(B \bigcap C^c) +
    \frac{P(B \bigcap C)}{P(C)}\left( P(C) - 1 \right) \\
=& P(B \bigcap C^c) - \frac{P(B \bigcap C)}{P(C)}P(C^c) \\
=& P(B \bigcap C^c) - P(B | C) P(C^c).
\end{align*}
$$

Certainly, $$P(B \bigcap C^c) \le P(C^c)$$ and $$P(B | C) P(C^c) \le P(C^c)$$.
So, by the triangle inequality,

$$
| P(B) - P(B | C) | \le P(B \bigcap C^c) + P(B | C) P(C^c) \le 2 P(C^c).
$$

I think this is what vdV had in mind.  Actually, you can drop the factor of
two by observing that

$$
\begin{align}
P(B \bigcap C^c) - P(B | C) P(C^c) =& P(C^c) (P(B | C^c) - P(B | C)) \Rightarrow\\
P(B \bigcap C^c) - P(B | C) P(C^c) \le& P(C^c) \quad \textrm{and}\\
-(P(B \bigcap C^c) - P(B | C) P(C^c)) =& P(C^c) (P(B | C) - P(B | C^c)) \\
\le& P(C^c),
\end{align}
$$

since the difference between any two probabilities is less than one.
