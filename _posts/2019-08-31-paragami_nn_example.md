In the below notebook, I make a version of [autograd's very simple neural
network
example](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd/blob/master/examples/neural_net.py)
using [my `paragami` package](https://github.com/rgiordan/paragami) as a more
readable alternative to `autograd`'s `flatten` function. The notebook itself
[can be downloaded
here](/assets/post_assets/2019-08-31-paragami_nn_example.ipynb).
