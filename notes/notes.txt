Good basic github pages + jekyll tutorial:
http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/


bundle exec ... # Run a command using the Gemfile in the current directory
bundle exec jekyll build    # Build the site into _site
bundle exec jekyll serve    # Serve the site locally for previewing

To convert from latex to markdown, you can use

pandoc -s example4.tex -o example5.md

To double the dollar signs, you can search and replace with the
obnoxious-looking regexps

([^\$])\$([^\s\$]+)\$([^\$])
$1$$$$$2$$$$$3

([^\n])\$\$\\begin\{aligned\}
$1\n$$$$\\begin{aligned}

\\end\{aligned\}\$\$([^\n])
$\\end{aligned}$$$$\n\n$1

\{\#[^\}]+\}


This post is a continuation of the previous post about van der Vaart's Theorem
7.2 {% post_url 2020-08-07-vdv_thm_7_2.md %}.  As before, these are just my
personal notes, with no guarantee of correctness nor insight.  (In fact, if
you're reading this and find an error or misunderstanding, I would love to hear
from you!)
